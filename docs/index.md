**Image-only PDFs:**

- Generated from scanned hard copy documents or images.
- Content is locked in a snapshot-like image without a text layer.
- Not searchable or editable without OCR (Optical Character Recognition).

**Searchable PDFs:**

- Result from applying OCR to scanned or image-based documents.
